# Tutorial: Quickly develop your first Python ExApp with GitHub Codespaces

::: info
This tutorial contains the same content as in Steps 1 and 2, but modified to work in GitHub Codespaces, intended for workshops or other situations where quick, short-term development is desired.

This tutorial assumes that you have followed the instructions for setting up an environment in GitHub Codespaces [here](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/iyNGp8ryWxc7Efa?path=%2F1a%20Set%20up%20a%20quick%20development%20environment%20with%20GitHub%20Codespaces).

:::

**The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarize yourself with the basic structure and functionalities of a Nextcloud ExApp in Python. For this tutorial, we will implement a ToGif app which displays a drop-down menu that converts a video file into GIF format.**

## 0 Install project dependencies and configure GitHub Codespaces

### 0a. Open port 80 to the public

In the Ports tab, you will see that all of the provided ports can only be accessed privately for security reasons. But, as we will see later, the ExApp will need to be able to communicate with the running Nextcloud instance via HTTP, and so one of the ports needs to be opened to allow such requests to pass through.

Right-click on port **80** and select **Port Visibility > Public** from the context menu that appears (see screenshot).

### 0b. Install Python

For Python development, the following software needs to be installed in the environment:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/),
- the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package installer, and
- the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) Python module.

For the example app in this tutorial, we also need:

- the [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) command-line tool.
- the [libGL](https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/libGL/) rendering library.

Run the following command in the provided terminal to install them:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv gifsicle libgl1 -y
```

### 0c. Install AppAPI

::: info
AppAPI is a Nextcloud app that provides a network interface allowing ExApps (deployed as separate web servers or Docker containers) to communicate with the Nextcloud core via one or more "deploy daemons."

For more details, you can view the AppAPI documentation [here](https://nextcloud.github.io/app_api/DevSetup.html).

:::

Navigate to the Nextcloud `apps` directory, and then retrieve the latest development version of AppAPI from GitHub:

```
cd /var/www/html/apps
```

```
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/app_api.git
```

Change into the newly created **app_api** app directory:

```
cd app_api
```

Install npm dependencies and build the front-end assets in development mode:

```
npm ci && npm run dev
```

Enable the app from the **Apps > Your apps** page in Nextcloud or via the `occ` command:

```
/var/www/html/occ app:enable --force app_api
```

### 0d. Create a Deploy Daemon

Create a deploy daemon for development with the `manual_install` type. You can do so in Nextcloud by heading to **Administration settings > AppAPI > Deploy Daemons** and clicking on **+ Register Daemon**. A form will pop up asking for the necessary information. Select "Manual install" for the daemon configuration template. Set the daemon host to `localhost` and remove `/index.php` from the Nextcloud URL. Leave all other fields at their default values. Click **Register** to confirm (see screenshot).

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 17-17-38 AppAPI - Administration settings - Nextcloud.png](.attachments.10600687/Screenshot%202024-12-02%20at%2017-17-38%20AppAPI%20-%20Administration%20settings%20-%20Nextcloud.png)

Alternatively, you can also do this from the terminal with the following `occ` command:

```
/var/www/html/occ app_api:daemon:register manual_install "Manual Install" manual-install http localhost https://<your-codespace-id>-80.app.github.dev
```

Replace `https://<your-codespace-id>-80.app.github.dev` with the URL assigned to the Nextcloud server running on port 80 (you can copy it from the list of ports in the codespace environment).

### 0e. Install the Notifications app

::: info
Depending on how Nextcloud is installed, certain apps may or may not be available out-of-the-box. This includes the Notifications app which is a required dependency for the example app in this tutorial. You can check the list of installed apps under **Apps > Your apps** and, if it is not installed, you can install it with the steps below.

:::

Back in the `apps` directory, retrieve the latest development version of the Notifications app from GitHub:

```
cd /var/www/html/apps && git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/notifications.git
```

Then, under **Apps > Your apps**, the app should now be added to the list and you can enable it from there. Refresh the page if you don't see it at first. Or, with the `occ` command:

```
/var/www/html/occ app:enable --force notifications
```

## 1 Clone the skeleton app to your local environment

::: info
Currently, the Nextcloud App Store does not provide a skeleton generator for ExApps, so we must download the [Python skeleton app](https://github.com/nextcloud/app-skeleton-python) directly from GitHub and manually change the app's metadata to suit our needs.

:::

In a separate directory (outside of the Nextcloud server directory), clone the latest version of the Python skeleton app into a new directory named **to_gif**. For simplicity, we can just clone the app into the home directory. Change into the newly created **to_gif** directory.

```
cd && git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/app-skeleton-python.git to_gif && cd to_gif
```

## 2 Optional information: An overview of the skeleton files

As with the [Hello World tutorial](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/iyNGp8ryWxc7Efa?path=%2F%2F2%20Develop%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20app), **you don't have to memorize this section and can even skip reading this chapter entirely**, but if you are interested in what the Python skeleton includes, read on.

Some of the files in this directory serve exactly the same purpose as in a classic Nextcloud app and so we won't repeat information from the previous tutorials here. Below, you'll find an overview of the new files and directories present in the Python skeleton app and the purpose for each.

| File/Folder        | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **./ex_app/**          | Contains all Python source code for the app                |
| **./Dockerfile**       | Contains instructions on how to build the Docker container |
| **./healthcheck.sh**   | Script for verifying the health of the Docker container    |
| **./requirements.txt** | The place to define all Python dependencies (if any)       |

Other files and directories not necessary for the core functionality of the app include:

- **./.run/** (IntelliJ project run configuration)
- **./.pre-commit-config.yaml** (Defines [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for automatic linting of source code)
- **./pyproject.toml** (Python linter config)

::: info
The most important file in this app is the `ex_app/lib/main.py` file which contains a minimal working Python example required for an ExApp to run. For a low-level explanation of the Python code, please refer to the documentation here:

<https://cloud-py-api.github.io/nc_py_api/NextcloudApp.html>

:::

## 3 Update app information

Open the skeleton app project folder in the Codespaces environment by selecting **Menu > File > Open Folder...** (or, with the equivalent shortcut, **Ctrl + K Ctrl + O**) and navigating to `/home/devcontainer/to_gif/` in the box provided (see screenshots).

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 17-20-13.png](.attachments.10600687/20241202_17h20m13s_grim.png)

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 17-25-43.png](.attachments.10600687/20241202_17h25m43s_grim.png)

Now, open `appinfo/info.xml` from the `to_gif` project file tree and change its contents to:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
	<id>to_gif</id>
	<name>ToGif</name>
	<summary>Nextcloud To Gif Example</summary>

				<access_level>USER</access_level>
				<headers_to_exclude>[]</headers_to_exclude>
			</route>
		</routes>
	</external-app>
</info>
```

::: info
Except for the `<external-app>` tag, all of the tags in this file are exactly the same as in a classic Nextcloud app. For some tags such as author, description, website, etc., feel free to change the values to your liking.

:::

Next, open the `Makefile` and change its contents to:

```make
APP_ID := to_gif
APP_NAME := ToGif
APP_VERSION := 1.0.0
APP_SECRET := 12345
APP_PORT := 9031

JSON_INFO := "{\"id\":\"$(APP_ID)\",\"name\":\"$(APP_NAME)\",\"daemon_config_name\":\"manual_install\",\"version\":\"$(APP_VERSION)\",\"secret\":\"$(APP_SECRET)\",\"port\":$(APP_PORT),\"routes\":[{\"url\":\".*\",\"verb\":\"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\",\"access_level\":1,\"headers_to_exclude\":[]}]}"

OCC=/var/www/html/occ

.PHONY: register
register:
	$(OCC) app_api:app:unregister $(APP_ID) --silent --force || true
	$(OCC) app_api:app:register $(APP_ID) manual_install --json-info $(JSON_INFO) --wait-finish
```

::: info
The `Makefile` registers some common operations/commands such as registering the app as make targets so that we don't have to type the entire commands every single time. For this tutorial, we only need the `register` target which will connect the local ExApp development server to AppAPI in Nextcloud, then register the app if the connection is successful. We also change the port number of the server (from 9030 to 9031), as no two servers are allowed to share the same port within the same host.

:::

## 4 Enable the app in Nextcloud

::: info
Unlike other (classic) Nextcloud apps, ExApps need to be setup to run as a separate web server that communicates with Nextcloud. In this step, we detail how to setup and start the server for the first time. If you decide to develop multiple ExApps in the future, the following commands must be executed for each ExApp to run on your machine.

:::

Create a new Python virtual environment for the ToGif app. The name of the environment doesn't matter, but for this tutorial, we will just use the name `env` for simplicity.

```
python3 -m venv env
```

If successful, this will create a local `env` directory that will house all of the app's Python package dependencies.

Now, activate the virtual environment:

```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

(Optional) Ensure that pip is updated to the latest version:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the app's project dependencies (which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the web server:

```
APP_ID=to_gif APP_PORT=9031 APP_SECRET=12345 APP_VERSION=1.0.0 NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://<your-codespace-id>-80.app.github.dev APP_HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 ex_app/lib/main.py
```

::: info
This command runs the `main.py` script which defines the app's API based on the [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) frameworks, and starts up a server configured with the environment variables specified above.

:::

While the above command is running, open a separate terminal by clicking on the **+** icon above the terminal, or you can use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + 5** to open a new terminal in a split view. Now, you can run:

```
make register
```

after which the app should now be enabled in Nextcloud. You can confirm this by going to the **Apps > Your apps** page, where you should see the ToGif app enabled in the list (see screenshot).

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 19-28-39 Your apps - App Store - Nextcloud.png](.attachments.10600687/Screenshot%202024-12-06%20at%2019-28-39%20Your%20apps%20-%20App%20Store%20-%20Nextcloud.png)

## 5 Changing the skeleton to suit our needs

As with the skeleton for the classic Nextcloud app, the Python skeleton app does nothing at the moment. We will now implement the ToGif app in this step.

First, we need to install some additional dependencies. Open the `requirements.txt` file and replace its contents with the following:

```
nc_py_api[app]>=0.14.0
pygifsicle
imageio
opencv-python
numpy
```

::: info
The Nextcloud Python Framework (or `nc_py_api` for short) is the Python package from which all ExApps in Python are built. For more information about the module and its capabilities, please refer to its documentation here:

<https://cloud-py-api.github.io/nc_py_api/index.html>

The remaining dependencies in this list are only needed for this tutorial only.

:::

Back in the first terminal where the web server is running, press **Ctrl + C** to stop the running server/process, then install the new dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, open the `ex_app/lib/main.py` file and replace its contents with the following:

```python
"""Simplest example of files_dropdown_menu + notification."""

from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
import os
from pathlib import Path

    nc.log(LogLvl.WARNING, f"Processing:{input_file.user_path} -> {save_path}")
    try:
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w+b") as tmp_in:
            nc.files.download2stream(input_file, tmp_in)

                image_lst = []
                previous_frame = None
                skip = 0
                while True:
                    skip += 1
                    ret, frame = cap.read()
                    if frame is None:
                        break
                    if skip == 2:
                        skip = 0
                        continue
                    if previous_frame is not None:

                            continue
                    frame_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
                    image_lst.append(frame_rgb)
                    previous_frame = frame
                    if len(image_lst) > 60:
                        break
                cap.release()

    except Exception as e:
        nc.log(LogLvl.ERROR, str(e))
        nc.notifications.create("Error occurred", "Error information was written to log file")


@APP.post("/video_to_gif")
async def video_to_gif(
    files: ActionFileInfoEx,
    nc: Annotated[NextcloudApp, Depends(nc_app)],
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
):
    for one_file in files.files:
        background_tasks.add_task(convert_video_to_gif, one_file.to_fs_node(), nc)
    return responses.Response()


def enabled_handler(enabled: bool, nc: NextcloudApp) -> str:
    # This will be called each time application is `enabled` or `disabled`
    # NOTE: `user` is unavailable on this step, so all NC API calls that require it will fail as unauthorized.
    print(f"enabled={enabled}")
    try:
        if enabled:
            nc.ui.files_dropdown_menu.register_ex(
                "to_gif",
                "To GIF",
                "/video_to_gif",
                mime="video",
                icon="img/icon.svg",
            )
            nc.log(LogLvl.WARNING, f"Hello from {nc.app_cfg.app_name} :)")
        else:
            nc.log(LogLvl.WARNING, f"Bye bye from {nc.app_cfg.app_name} :(")
    except Exception as e:
        # In case of an error, a non-empty short string should be returned, which will be shown to the NC administrator.
        return str(e)
    return ""


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Wrapper around `uvicorn.run`.
    # You are free to call it directly, with just using the `APP_HOST` and `APP_PORT` variables from the environment.
    os.chdir(Path(__file__).parent)
    run_app("main:APP", log_level="trace")
```

::: info
A quick explanation of the Python code: ExApps in Python are implemented as instances of the `FastAPI` class. Each time the app is enabled or disabled, the `enabled_handler` function is called, adding or removing the **To GIF** action in the drop-down menu as appropriate. When a POST request to the "/video_to_gif" endpoint is made (triggered by clicking on the **To GIF** button), the `video_to_gif` function takes the selected file(s) and adds a background task for each file to the queue. Each background task calls the `convert_video_to_gif` function which performs the actual conversion.

:::

Finally, we need an icon to display in the drop-down menu for this action. Create an `img` directory in the `ex_app` directory, download the app icon from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-py-api/nc_py_api/refs/heads/main/examples/as_app/to_gif/img/icon.svg), and place the file in the `img` directory.

```
mkdir -p ex_app/img && cd ex_app/img
```

```
curl -SsLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-py-api/nc_py_api/refs/heads/main/examples/as_app/to_gif/img/icon.svg
```

## 6 Test the app

In order for the changes to be reflected in Nextcloud, we need to rebuild the server. Change back into the app root directory and start the server again.

```
APP_ID=to_gif APP_PORT=9031 APP_SECRET=12345 APP_VERSION=1.0.0 NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://<your-codespace-id>-80.app.github.dev APP_HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 ex_app/lib/main.py
```

::: info
Tip: in a terminal, you can also press the **Up** arrow key multiple times to retrieve and auto-fill the previous commands, and then press **Enter** to execute the selected command again.

:::

Then, in the second terminal, re-register the app:

```
make register
```

Now, open the Files app in Nextcloud and navigate to the **Media** directory. Create the directory if it doesn't exist already. Add your favorite videos to this directory (although each should be limited to a few seconds at most). If the ToGif app is running successfully, you should be able to right-click on one of the video files and select **To GIF** from the drop-down menu. You can also select multiple video files and click on the **To GIF** button that appears at the top.

After a short while, you will receive a notification for each video that has been successfully converted to a GIF (see screenshot). You can then refresh the page in order to view them in the files list.

## What's next?

Congratulations! Now you know the basics of developing a Nextcloud ExApp! We hope that after following these steps, you will be able to continue developing and publishing more Nextcloud ExApps, whether it be in Python or in any other language. If you want to see more examples, the `nc_py_api` documentation includes some code for building a simple UI [here](https://cloud-py-api.github.io/nc_py_api/NextcloudUiApp.html), while the [reference section](https://cloud-py-api.github.io/nc_py_api/reference/index.html) lists all of the functionality that is available in the Python module.

## Questions?

If something is wrong, check the Nextcloud server logs or [ask for help in the Nextcloud forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/new-tutorial-develop-your-first-exapp-in-python/205108).
