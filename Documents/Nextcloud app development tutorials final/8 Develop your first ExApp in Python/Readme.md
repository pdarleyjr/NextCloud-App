# Tutorial: Develop your first ExApp in Python

**Up until now, the previous tutorials have all demonstrated how to develop Nextcloud apps the "classical" way (i.e. in PHP). However, we also recognize that not all developers are familiar with PHP, or that some developers do not want to use PHP for various reasons. Because of that, we have developed an API that allows developers to write Nextcloud apps in any desired programming language. Nextcloud apps written in languages other then PHP are what we call ExApps (short for "external apps"). In this tutorial, we will develop an example ExApp in Python, but similar principles can be applied to any other programming language as well.**

**By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:**

* [ ] **setup a local environment for developing ExApps,**
* [ ] **develop your first ExApp, and**
* [ ] **debug and make changes to an ExApp.**

### Required knowledge:

We assume you have followed all of the previous tutorials, from setting up a development environment to developing a complete Nextcloud app.

This tutorial is for anyone who is familiar with developing Nextcloud apps but want to start developing apps in other programming languages.

::: warn
In the tutorial, we assume you have a development environment created through the Nextcloud Docker setup. This is the only Nextcloud instance that you need for this tutorial.

For an alternative tutorial that just uses GitHub Codespaces, you only need to open the file titled [Quickly develop your first ExApp with GitHub Codespaces](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/iyNGp8ryWxc7Efa?dir=undefined&path=%2F8%20Develop%20your%20first%20ExApp%20in%20Python&openfile=10600687).
