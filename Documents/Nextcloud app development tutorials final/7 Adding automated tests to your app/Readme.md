# Tutorial: Adding automated tests to your app

**In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up automated tests in your app using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a great tool for app developers because with this tool, app developers don't have to deploy a test environment for all of the different Nextcloud, PHP and database system versions. It is also convenient to have tests triggered automatically so that they are run on each pull request, for example. In this tutorial, you will learn:**

- **How to use GitHub Actions to set up a specific Nextcloud test environment**
- **How to configure which tests to run**
- **How to implement tests**
- **How to check if the tests ran successfully**

## Required knowledge:

For this tutorial, we will be using the app created in the previous tutorial, "Developing a complete app with a navigation bar and database".

::: warn
In the tutorial we assume you have a development environment created through the Nextcloud Docker setup. This is the only Nextcloud instance that you need for this tutorial. Everything will happen in this instance.
