# Tutorial: Developing a dashboard widget with Vue.js

**In this tutorial, you will learn how to develop a dashboard widget with Vue.js. We will first create a simple dashboard widget without Vue.js to explain the concepts around dashboard widgets, and then we will create a second dashboard widget with the Vue components. Additionally, we will show an alternative way to create a simple dashboard widget without any JavaScript whatsoever. After this tutorial, you will know:**

* **How to implement a simple dashboard widget with and without JavaScript**
* **Repetition of app architecture concepts that were introduced in the previous tutorials**
* **Introduction to adding translations to your app**
* **Introduction to using Vue.js by building a dashboard widget using Nextcloud Vue components**

**The tutorial will guide you through the steps to create three dashboard widgets: one widget displays a list of the cat GIF file names, and the other two will display previews of those cat GIFs.**

## Required knowledge:

For this tutorial, we assume you have followed all of the previous tutorials, including how to set up a development environment, creating a Hello World app, and creating a simple interface-only app.

This tutorial is for anyone who is new to developing Nextcloud apps but do have a working development environment and are familiar with the structure of the Nextcloud app architecture.

::: warn
In the tutorial we assume you have a development environment created through the Nextcloud Docker setup. This is the only Nextcloud instance that you need for this tutorial. Everything will happen in this instance.
