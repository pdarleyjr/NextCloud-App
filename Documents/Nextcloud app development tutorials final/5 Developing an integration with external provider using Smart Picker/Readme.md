# Tutorial: Developing an integration with external provider using Smart Picker

**In this tutorial, you will learn how to develop an integration with external provider using the Smart Picker. Smart Picker is a feature that was first released in Nextcloud Hub 4 (Nextcloud 26) and is the easiest and fastest way to create integrations that also interact with many different Nextcloud apps. After this tutorial, you will know:**

- **What the Smart Picker is**
- **How to add a unified search provider which searches in your external software using a web service API**
- **How to make the Smart Picker use this search provider to get links to external resources**
- **How to ensure these links get rendered in Nextcloud apps like Text, Talk, Notes, Deck, Collectives, and Mail**
- **How to customize the rendering of these links**
- **How to create admin settings**
- **How to update your development environment so you are developing against the latest development release of Nextcloud**

**This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating an integration with the stock photo site [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). After this tutorial, you can use this app as an example to develop your own integration. If it is good enough, you can submit it to the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/) and make it available to a larger audience.**
