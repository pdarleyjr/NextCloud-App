**With this tutorial, you can set up a development environment quickly. This spins up a workable Nextcloud environment to work on. This is great for workshops or if you just quickly want to dip your toes in Nextcloud development. With this development environment, you can follow the ["Hello World" app development tutorial](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/iyNGp8ryWxc7Efa?path=%2F%2F2%20Develop%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20app) and the "ToGif" ExApp development tutorial. If you are looking for a more permanent solution or want to do more advanced tutorials, we recommend you to set up a local development environment for which we also have [a separate tutorial](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/iyNGp8ryWxc7Efa?path=%2F1%20Setting%20up%20a%20development%20environment).**
