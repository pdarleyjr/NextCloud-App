# Welcome to the Nextcloud app development tutorials!

Have you always wanted to learn how to develop apps for Nextcloud? These tutorials should help flatten your learning curve.

The goal is to create and share tutorials that are easy to follow **for people who don't have extensive coding experience or who are a little bit scared of the command line**.

We know, tutorials online are often very hard and stressful to follow. Sometimes the writer assumes knowledge you lack, sometimes steps are skipped because they seem obvious to the writer but not to you, or they lack linearity and link to other websites with dependent steps you have to follow. We made the following decisions when writing these tutorials:

* We write with a language that does not assume any prior knowledge.
* The tutorials are meant to enable new people to get into Nextcloud, and are not necessarily suitable for experts who are looking for more in-depth knowledge.
* Most tutorials are tested by someone who is not a developer.
* We link to external tutorials as little as possible. (We are aware that writers of tutorials often link to external sites to not have to repeat themselves and to prevent the tutorial from becoming unusable when software dependencies change, but we decided to follow a different path.)
