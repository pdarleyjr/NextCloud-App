About pull requests in GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides you with many of the capabilities you might need to work with pull requests:

    Create a pull request - Using either the Terminal and Git commands or the "Source Control" view, you can create pull requests just as you would on GitHub. If the repository uses a pull request template, you'll be able to use this within the "Source Control" view.
    Open a pull request â€“ You can open an existing pull request in a codespace, provided you have codespace access to the branch that is being merged in.
    Review a pull request - Once you have opened a pull request in a codespace, you can use the "GitHub Pull Request" view to add review comments and approve pull requests. You can also use GitHub Codespaces to view review comments.

Reviewing a pull request in Codespaces

    With your default editor set to either Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Code for Web, open the pull request in a codespace, as described in Opening a pull request in Codespaces previously in this article.

    In the Activity Bar, click the Git pull request icon to display the "GitHub Pull Request" side bar. This icon is only displayed in the Activity Bar when you open a pull request in a codespace.

    If you opened a pull request in a codespace and the pull request icon is not displayed in the Activity Bar, make sure you are signed in to GitHub. Click the GitHub icon in the Activity Bar then click Sign in.

To do this, click and hold the + sign next to the first line you want to suggest changing, then drag the + sign to the last line you want to suggest changing. Then click Make a Suggestion in the comment box that's displayed.

    The lines you selected are copied into the comment box, where you can edit them to suggest a change. You can add a comment above the line containing ```suggestion to explain your suggested change.

    Click Add Comment to add your suggestion to the pull request.

    Screenshot of a suggested change. The "Make a Suggestion" and "Add Comment" buttons are shown below the suggested change.

    When you are finished adding review comments, you can add a summary comment for your pull request review in the "GitHub Pull Request" side bar. You can then click Comment and Submit, or click the dropdown arrow and select Approve and Submit or Request Changes and Submit.
